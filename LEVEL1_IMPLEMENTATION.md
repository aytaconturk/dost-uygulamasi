# Level 1, Step 1 Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Image Analysis API Integration
- **New API Endpoint**: `https://arge.aquateknoloji.com/webhook-test/dost/level1`
- **Request Format**: JSON with `imageUrl` parameter
- **Image URL Used**: `https://dost.muhbirai.com/src/assets/images/story1.png` (for ants story)

### 2. Text-to-Speech Functionality
- Converts API response to speech using browser's built-in `speechSynthesis` API
- Turkish language support (`tr-TR`)
- Adjustable speech rate and pitch for child-friendly narration
- Replay functionality to listen to the analysis again

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Image Analysis Button**: "üîç G√∂rseli Analiz Et" button to trigger API call
- **Analysis Result Display**: Shows the AI analysis response in a formatted green box
- **Replay Button**: "üîÑ Tekrar Dinle" to replay the text-to-speech
- **User Input Area**: Large textarea for children to write their observations
- **Progress Flow**: Only allows progression after both analysis is complete and user has written their thoughts

### 4. Preserved Existing APIs
- **Voice Recording API**: `https://arge.aquateknoloji.com/webhook/faaba651-a1ad-4f6c-9062-0ebc7ca93bcb` (unchanged)
- All existing voice recording functionality remains intact
- Ready for second API integration when microphone is clicked

## üéØ User Flow

1. **Step 1 Start**: User sees the ants image and DOST mascot's question
2. **Analysis**: User clicks "G√∂rseli Analiz Et" button
3. **API Call**: System sends image URL to analysis API
4. **Response**: AI provides text analysis of the image
5. **Speech**: Text is automatically converted to speech and played
6. **User Input**: User writes their own observations in the textarea
7. **Progression**: User can proceed to next step only after completing both actions

## üîß Technical Features

- **Error Handling**: Fallback text provided if API fails
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during analysis
- **Responsive Design**: Works on tablets and mobile devices
- **Child-Friendly**: Large buttons, colorful interface, simple navigation
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigation

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Next Steps

- Define second API endpoint for voice recording after microphone click
- Add more sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms
- Consider adding loading animations for better user experience
- Test with actual API responses to refine text-to-speech parameters
